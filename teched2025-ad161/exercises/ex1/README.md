# Exercise 1 - Build CAP app xflights

In this exercise, you will create the xflights app from scratch. You will run the app locally
and query its data via OData requests.

All file or directory paths in this exercise are relative to the workspace folder _ws_
created in the [Preparation](../ex0/README.md) section.


## Exercise 1.1 - Create xflights project

After completing these steps, you will have the basic project structure of the xflights app.

1. In VS Code, open a terminal.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_01_0010.png)

2. Go to the terminal and create the xflights project with
    ```sh
    cds init xflights && cd xflights
    ```
    This creates a directory _xflights_ with the basic structure for a CAP app.
    Then it also changes your current directory to _xflights_.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_01_0020.png)

3. In folder _xflights_, add a file _.env_ with this content:
    ```
    # Start on port 4005 by default, leaving 4004 for the xtravels app
    cds.server.port = 4005
    ```

4. Even though the app is still empty, start it now. In the terminal, run `cds watch`:
    ```sh
    cds watch
    ```
    When you add further components to the app later, `cds watch` will automatically pick them up.

5. See the output in the terminal:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_01_0030.png)



## Exercise 1.2 - Add the domain model

After completing these steps, you will have defined the essential entities of the xflights app.

The first part of the new app is the domain model with these entities:
* Airlines  
  A list of airlines that operate flights (e.g. "Sunset Wings").
* Airports  
  Airports where flights depart and arrive.
* Connections  
  Defines flight connections. Each connection is operated by an airline
  and has a departure and an arrival airport (e.g. "SW0058" by Sunset Wings from San Francisco to Frankfurt departing at 01:45 P.M.).
* Flights  
  Lists the concrete flights, i.e. a connection operated at a given date (e.g. "SW0058" operated at 2023-07-31).
* Supplements  
  Things you can add to a flight, like additional luggage, food, drinks.

<br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_02_0010.png)


1. In folder _xflights/db_, create a file named _schema.cds_.

2. Copy the content of [assets/ex1/schema.cds](../../assets/ex1/schema.cds) into the new file. 

3. Observe the console output for `cds watch`. As soon as you save the file _schema.cds_,
the still running `cds watch` reacts immediately with new output like this:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_02_0020.png)

    `cds watch` detected the changes in _db/schema.cds_ and automatically
    bootstrapped an in-memory SQLite database when restarting the server process.

    Note that due to the _.env_ file, xflights is started on port 4005.
    This becomes important later, when you start the xtravels app in parallel.


> [!TIP]
> It can happen that `cds watch` doesn't detect a change automatically.
In that case, simply press Return within the log output, or stop it via `Ctrl+C` and restart it.

## Exercise 1.3 - Add OData service

After completing these steps, you will have an OData service for the _xflights_ app.

Now you add an OData service that allows us to see the data in the app. This could be extended
to a full fledged maintenance UI for the xflights app, but this is not part of this session.

1. In folder _xflights/srv_, create a file _flights-service.cds_.

2. Fill the file with this content:
    ```cds
    using { sap.capire.flights as my } from '../db/schema';

    service FlightsService {
      entity Connections as projection on my.Connections;
      entity Flights as projection on my.Flights;
      entity Airlines as projection on my.Airlines;
      entity Airports as projection on my.Airports;
      entity Supplements as projection on my.Supplements;
    }
    ```
    This defines a service that simply exposes all the metadata entities as one-to-one projections.

3. Observe the output of `cds watch`:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_03_0010.png)

    Service `FlightsService` is now served as OData service.

4. Open the automatically served index page in your browser at [localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005/).
The entities are exposed via OData.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_03_0020-60.png)

5. Click on the link for `Flights`. You will see that there are no entities yet.


## Exercise 1.4 - Add test data

After completing these steps, you will have test data in the xflights app.

Now you have a service that allows us to query the metadata and the entities,
but this is still a bit boring, as there is no data in the tables.
You will now add some CSV files with data for the xflights app.

1. Copy the folder [assets/ex1/data](../../assets/ex1/data) into folder _xflights/db_.
The result should look like this:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_04_0010.png)


2. Observe the console output: `cds watch` automatically restarts and detects the data files:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_04_0020.png)

3. Go back to the index page [localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005/) and click on any of the entities to see the new content.


## Exercise 1.5 - Fiori preview

After completing these steps, you will have preconfigured columns in the Fiori preview.

If you want use the Fiori preview functionality of the index page, you have to
manually configure the columns to be displayed. This can be avoided
by adding a few Fiori `@UI.LineItem` annotations to define a default layout
for entities `Flights` and `Connections`.

1. In folder _xflights/app_, create a new file _layout.cds_.

2. Fill the file with this content:
    ```cds
    using { FlightsService } from '../srv/flights-service';

    annotate FlightsService.Connections with @UI.LineItem: [
      { Value: ID },
      { Value: (airline.ID) },
      { Value: (origin.ID) },
      { Value: (destination.ID) },
      { Value: departure },
      { Value: arrival },
      { Value: distance }
    ];

    annotate FlightsService.Flights with @UI.LineItem: [
      { Value: (flight.ID) },
      { Value: date },
      { Value: aircraft },
      { Value: price },
      { Value: (currency.code) },
      { Value: maximum_seats },
      { Value: occupied_seats }
    ];
    ```

3. Wait until `cds watch` has picked up the changes. Then go back to the
index page on [localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005/) and click the
"Fiori preview" link for entity `Flights` or `Connections`.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_05_0010-60.png)

    The columns specified in the `@UI.LineItem` annotations are shown by default.


## Exercise 1.6 - Localized metadata

After completing these steps, you will have localized labels in the Fiori preview.

In the Fiori preview, you see that the column labels are simply the element names.
You now change this to display appropriate labels in the correct language.

1. In folder _xflights/db_, add a file _labels.cds_.

2. Fill the new file with this content:
    ```cds
    using { sap.capire.flights } from './schema';

    annotate flights.Connections with {
      ID          @title: '{i18n>Flight}';
      airline     @title: '{i18n>Airline}';
      origin      @title: '{i18n>Origin}';
      destination @title: '{i18n>Destination}';
      departure   @title: '{i18n>Departure}';
      arrival     @title: '{i18n>Arrival}';
      distance    @title: '{i18n>Distance}';
    }

    annotate flights.Flights with {
      flight         @title: '{i18n>Flight}';
      date           @title: '{i18n>FlightDate}';
      aircraft       @title: '{i18n>PlaneType}';
      price          @title: '{i18n>FlightPrice}';
      maximum_seats  @title: '{i18n>MaximumSeats}';
      occupied_seats @title: '{i18n>OccupiedSeats}';
    }
    ```
    The annotations provide a title for some of the elements of the `Connections` and `Flights` entities.

3. The values of the annotations are `i18n` ("internationalization") keys. The respective texts need to be added to the app.
Copy the folder [assets/ex1/_i18n](../../assets/ex1/_i18n) into folder _xflights_.

    The result should look like this:

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_06_0010.png)

3. Go back to the browser window with the Fiori preview and refresh.
Notice the change in the column labels.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_06_0020-60.png)



## Exercise 1.7 - Add API service

After completing these steps, you will have an additional service
that acts as an API to retrieve some data from the xflights app.

1. In folder _xflights/srv_, add a file _data-service.cds_.

2. Fill the file with this content:
    ```cds
    using { sap, sap.capire.flights as my } from '../db/schema';

    // Service for data integration

    @hcql @rest @odata 
    service sap.capire.flights.data {

      // Serve Flights data with inlined connection details
      @readonly entity Flights as projection on my.Flights {
        key flight.ID, flight.{*} excluding { ID },
        key date, // preserve the flight date as a key
        *, // include all other fields from my.Flights
        maximum_seats - occupied_seats as free_seats : Integer,
      } excluding { flight };

      // Serve Airlines, Airports, and Supplements data as is
      @readonly entity Airlines as projection on my.Airlines;
      @readonly entity Airports as projection on my.Airports;
      @readonly entity Supplements as projection on my.Supplements;
    }

    // temporary workaround for taming @cds.autoexpose
    annotate sap.common.Currencies with @cds.autoexpose:false;
    annotate sap.common.Countries with @cds.autoexpose:false;
    annotate sap.common.Languages with @cds.autoexpose:false;
    ```

    In this service, entity `Flights` is not a simple one-to-one projection of the
    respective entity in the domain model. Instead of having two separate entities
    for connections and flights, the connection data is directly pulled
    into the `Flights` entity ("denormalization"). This is done via the `flight`
    association that is part of entity `sap.capire.flights.Flights`.
    This denormalization is applied because a consumer simply wants to see the
    list of flights and doesn't need to be bothered with the fact that in xflights
    the data is normalized - separated into two entities ("use-case oriented service").

    As this service is intended to be imported in other apps, we have chosen
    a longer name that indicates where it comes from.

    The service has some annotations that control how the data of the entities
    is made available: via OData, via plain rest, and via the CAP specific `hcql` protocol
    (which basically is the transport of [CQL](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cql) - an extension of SQL that adds support for path expressions - over HTTP).

> [!TIP]
> Annotations `@hcql`, `@rest`, and `@odata` are shortcuts for the corresponding
[`@protocol`](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-serve#protocol) annotation.

3. `cds watch` automatically picks up the new service. In the browser, go back to the index page
on [localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005/) and see the new service being presented via these protocols
(you may need to refresh the page).

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_07_0010-60.png)


4. Click for example the [Flights](http://localhost:4005/rest/data/Flights) link in
the section for the rest service to see the data.
Notice how the connection data (e.g. columns `departure` and `arrival`) have become part of the Flights entity.


## Exercise 1.8 - Export API service

After completing these steps, you will have an API package for
the new service `sap.capire.flights.data`.

In [Exercise 2](../ex2/README.md) you will create the xtravels app,
which calls the API service `sap.capire.flights.data` of xflights
to get flights data. In order to do that, xtravels needs a definition
of the API.

You now export the API service `sap.capire.flights.data` as an "API package" that can be
seamlessly integrated in other apps.
This package contains everything that is needed in a consuming app, including some test data.

1. In the terminal, stop `cds watch` via `Ctrl+C`.

2. Run the command (assuming you are still in folder _xflights_):
    ```sh
    cds export -s sap.capire.flights.data --to ../apis/flights-data
    ```
    This creates the API package as folder _apis/flights-data_ directly in our workspace folder.
    Usually you would publish the API package, e.g. via npm or GitHub. For our session it
    is sufficient to have it inside the workspace folder.

3. Add these lines to the end of the generated file _apis/flights-data/index.cds_:
    ```cds
    // Workaround for @cds.autoexpose kicking in too eagerly ...
    annotate sap.common.Currencies with @cds.autoexpose:false;
    annotate sap.common.Countries with @cds.autoexpose:false;
    annotate sap.common.Languages with @cds.autoexpose:false;
    ```
    As the auto-exposure mechanism of the compiler doesn't yet seamlessly work together
    with exporting and importing APIs, you need to apply these annotations as a workaround.

4. Have a look at the new folder _apis/flights-data_.

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/01_08_0010.png)

    * The most important part is the service definition in _apis/flights-data/services.csn_.
      It is a CSN that contains only the entities exposed in service `sap.capire.flights.data`.
      Note that the CSN only describes the API: the `query` sections are not present in the entities.
    * The API package has a _package.json_ that defines a name `xflights-flights-data` for the package.
      This name will be used to import the API package in the next exercise.
    * The package has an _\_i18n_ folder with the localized metadata that is used in the service.
    * There is a _data_ folder with some test data. This data is extracted by starting the app in the
      background and querying the entities in the service.



## Exercise 1.9 - Cleanup

If you haven't done yet, stop `cds watch` by typing `Ctrl+C` into the terminal.



## Summary

You've now created CAP app xflights that serves as source for flight master data.
